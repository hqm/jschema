What is the API to the sensorimotor system? 

Models:
  blocks with friction, density, texture

   server can implementat 'sticky' blocks



Motor output:

Arms are set as two joints and a hand:

  Gross motor action: upper arm, moves to a quadrant of screen, say 1/10 quantized

  Fine motor action: lower arm, moves 1/10 of quadrant

  Rotator Joints at the shoulder and elbow, i.e., there is redundancy for reaching a point but that
  allows for better reuse of relative motion schemas

  Gross and fine joints have control over force left,right, up/down

  - The motor system provides both force and a targeted 'move to proprioceptive position' function. E.g., 
  we've got a fairly high level motor system.

  hand: grasp, ungrasp, rotate left, rotate right
    grasp and rotate force is controllable over some range


    HEAD: rotatation , translation

    Gaze: 10x10 gross angle quantization
    	  10x10 fine angle position

Also see Vision system, there is 'motor control' of internal pipeline vision filters, you can
choose which ones go into pipeline

Sensor inputs:

  Proprioception: 
     10x10 location for gross motor system - divided into x,y axis? 
     10x10 location for fine motor system 
     shoulder and elbow joint position

Force/touch

     force on shoulder joint, x, y, rotation

     force on elbox x,y,rotation

     force on wrist join rotation, x, y 

     force on grasp

     touch on fingers, texture, temperature, heat conductivity, on fingers. 

     

Vision

  modules:

  broad-area vision - blob detection per quadrant, a couple of bits of color/grayscale

  fovea operations:

     closed area fill - is area at fovea closed? 
     are there any bits on at the fovea ; color, density, texture (image morphology bank of filters)

  filter system (image morphology)
    prescale
    erode/dilate
        

   motion tracking; attention focus points on fovea and broad-area peripheral vision  when motion is sensed

   trajectory - when motion detected, a motion vector input is stimulated

Audio

  Basic frequency burst (pop, click, boom), localization from auditory system to a quadrant
